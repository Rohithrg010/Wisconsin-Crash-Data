# Wisconsin Crash Data Visualization Project

This project analyzes Wisconsin traffic crash data to uncover patterns related to accident frequency, severity, location hotspots, weather conditions, and seasonal trends. The goal is to transform raw crash records into meaningful insights that can inform road safety awareness, infrastructure planning, and policy decisions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset contains comprehensive traffic incident records from Wisconsin, including:
- Date and time of crashes  
- Location and region  
- Weather and road conditions  
- Type of collision  
- Vehicles involved  
- Drivers and passengers  

Using this data, we explored how environmental and regional factors influence crash trends across the state.

## ❓ Key Questions Addressed

- How do weather and road conditions affect crash frequency and severity?
- Which regions and counties are traffic incident hotspots?
- What are the peak accident months across different regions in Wisconsin?

## 📈 Visualizations Created

1. **Heat Map of Traffic Incident Hotspots**  
   Identifies high-risk regions, highlighting urban centers such as Milwaukee and Madison.

2. **Stacked Bar Chart of Weather Conditions vs. Accident Severity**  
   Shows how accident severity varies under different weather conditions, revealing that many crashes occur during clear and cloudy weather.

3. **Line Chart of Monthly Accident Trends**  
   Displays seasonal trends across regions, with mid-year peaks and regional variations in crash frequency.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Favorable weather conditions do not necessarily reduce accidents, suggesting human factors play a major role.
- Urban areas experience higher crash concentrations due to traffic density.
- Accident frequency shows strong seasonal and regional patterns across Wisconsin.
